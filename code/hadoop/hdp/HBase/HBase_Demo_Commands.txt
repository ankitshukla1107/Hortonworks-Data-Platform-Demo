Demo: Import movie ratings into HBase
a) Create a HBase table for movie ratings by user
b) Then show we can quickly query it for individual users
c) Good example of sparse data

DATA MODEL OF HBASE TABLE IS AS BELOW-
--------------------------------------
						Column family: rating
			rating:50	rating:33	rating:223
userID		   1			5			5

where userID is unique key, rating:50 is column family identifier

Built a service that gives all the ratings for given userID

HOW ARE WE DOING IT?
---------------------
python client --> REST service --> HBase --> HDFS

Demo: (Not Working)
-------------------

1) Login as admin and start HBASE
2) Launch REST Server sitting on top of HBase so that it can communicate with outside world by executing below command at /home/maria_dev from root user
--> /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/hbase-daemon.sh start rest -p 8000 --infoport 8001

3) yum -y install python-pip

4) Ensure u.data is available at /home/maria_dev/ml-100k/

5) Run HBaseExamples.py available at /home/maria_dev

6) Stop services
a) /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop rest
